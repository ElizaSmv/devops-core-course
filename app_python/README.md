# Show Your Time

Here I developed small Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow.

## Before the start

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install required dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start
Run the application using the following command
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Default running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
Note: run this command from the `app` directory

### Testing
Run `pytest` command from the `app_python` directory
